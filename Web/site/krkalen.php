Krkal is an excellent logical-action game. The player views from above the character he controls. The game splits into many levels. In each level, the goal is to pass through the "labyrinth", avoid all dangerous traps and reach the EXIT. You can see that the basic idea is very simple. However, the realization becomes a nightmare - at least in the advanced levels.

In general, the difficulty of action elements is rather easy or medium (with a few exceptions) and many levels do not contain any action at all. In the other hand, the difficulty of the logic elements slowly increases from zero to nearly godlike level.

On the first look, Krkal may resemble games like Boulderdash (Supaplex) or Robbo, but none of these can even dream about being compared to Krkal. Krkal contains a huge number of miscellaneous "things" or "objects" - the build elements, from which the level is finally made up. With such an arsenal of various items, the level design may be extremely diversified. The level diversity is what makes Krkal different. Simply, each level in Krkal is original and unique.

Why on earth does it call KRKAL? Because we decided so... Well: Krkal is the abbreviation of names Krcek and Altman(n) and it sounds pretty good. If you do not think so, be sure that this quibble will remain undisclosed to you unless you learn Czech :-)

When playing Krkal, the rule number one is to keep your eyes open and attend to everything around. Everything here means EVERYTHING. Usually, no objects are needless in the level. As you notice something, you can start thinking: "What is this thing, what does it bear on and what can I use it for". Especially you should focus on inconspicuous objects not available to you right now or things that seem to be useless. Remember that although you may not have any idea how to get somewhere, it does not mean it is impossible! Next, you have to take into account that many levels may be completed using more than one way. Often, you have to choose the order in which you take your actions. Sometimes the order does not matter at all, but sometimes a wrong order causes that you cannot reach the victory any more.
