<h1>System KRKAL 2.4 (demo) - free download</h1>
<p>
Download system KRKAL (including the game Krkal) and enjoy playing! You can create new levels, modify the game or even create your own game. We do not regard the latest version 2.4 for a final product, so much for the demo signature. This version includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>KRKAL, the system for 2D games development</b> - nearly finished, we know about a few compiler bugs and some of our keen planes were not realized yet. Although KRKAL was intended to be a universal system, it is still a little specialized on games like Krkal. We will have to do some work on the generalization.
</li>
<li>
<b>Game Krkal</b> - we tried to resurrect good old Krkal within the new system. Excepting few important objects (a laser for instance), we succeeded. We were able to convert about a half of original Krkal levels and created new ones. We still work to complete the Krkal development.
</li>
<li>
The new gorgeous <b>graphics</b> and finally, you all can enjoy a <b>beautiful music</b> by Frolík.
</li>
<li>
<b>Detailed documentation</b> (editor, description of the game) including the documentation for experienced users (how to write the scripts, KRKAL C reference manual, Krkal programmer's documentation).
